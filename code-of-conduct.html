                <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetings are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout all events. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, inclusive environment for everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we expect you to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Behave professionally.</li>
                        <li>Be respectful to others.</li>
                        <li>Not insult or put down others experience or ability.</li>
                        <li>Share and be nice.</li>

                <h4>Need Help?</h4>
                <p>You can contact the organisers by sending a direct message to @dundeephp on twitter or speak to an organiser, in person, at an event.</p>
                <p>Dundee PHP is part of a larger community of PHP User Groups, around the world. If you feel your complaint requires external arbitration, let one of the organisers know and we can discuss the issue with the organisers of those User Groups.</p>
                <hr />
                <h4>The Quick Version</h4>
                <p>Our user group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
                <hr />
                <h4>The Less Quick Version</h4>
                <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund.</p>
                <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately.</p>
                <p>The organisers will be happy to help participants in contacting the local police constabulary, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any events. We value your attendance.</p>
                <p>We expect community participants to follow these rules at all times, including at meetups, conferences, workshops, via our online communities (Twitter, Facebook, Google Groups, GitHub, IRC, etc.) and any related socials.</p>
